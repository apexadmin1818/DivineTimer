# Advanced Usage

This page provides additional information about using Bodhi Timer beyond the basic instructions in the main README.

## Voice commands

Long press the clock button to use speech recognition. Speak one or more durations separated by the word "again" to queue multiple timers.

## Custom sounds

You can select any ringtone on your device or import your own audio file to use as the timer sound. Configure this option from the preferences screen.

## Automatic restarts

Enable the auto-restart option if you want the timer to start again automatically once it finishes. This is useful when creating a sequence of timed sessions.
