# About
Divine Timer is an elegant, minimalist countdown timer.
A navigation tab with The Christ Prayer has been added to prime the mind to reach out to Divine Consciousness during your meditation.
It is designed mainly for use as a meditation timer but can easily be used for any similar purpose.
This app is free and developed as open-source software. 
It collects no data and uses the minimal permissions necessary.


## How to use

Set the time via the clock icon in the top left.  You may set presets by choosing a time then holding down on one of the three preset buttons.

Pause / resume via the button in the bottom left, and stop the timer via the button in the bottom right.  The top right button is the preference button.

Animation may be toggled between an image and one of four circle animations, chosen from the preferences screen.

It uses Android's built-in notification system to trigger the alarm, which means it works even when your device is asleep.
